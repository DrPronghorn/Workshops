# Neotoma Workshops

![Packrat.png]

The [Neotoma Paleoecological Database](http://neotomadb.org) is committed to outreach directed at multiple user groups including public school students and teachers, community groups, and academic users.  To facilitate coordinated outreach we have developed a number of teaching modules, and will likely continue developing modules.  These modules are stored in this repository.
