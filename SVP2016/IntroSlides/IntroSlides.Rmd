## Learning Objectives

Workshop participants will learn:

- how to search and acquire faunal data using web tools and how to peruse the data using online mapping functions. 
- how to use Neotomaâ€™s APIs (Application Programming Interface) and the neotoma R package to write scripts to import Neotoma data into R for further analysis and perform simple analyses with those scripts. 
- to use R as a tool for data and metadata entry. 
- how to reconcile results across Neotoma and the Paleobiology Databases

## Getting started
* All slides can be found here #insert link
* Installing R (and optionally, R Studio)

## What is Neotoma?
- Database consortium- so can organize around a major database/dataset or contribute individual files
- Neotoma ecosystem
    - Faunal data
        - FAUNMAP
        - MIOMAP
        - ANTIGUA (South America)
        - MQMD (Mexico)
    - Pollen and plant macros
    - Packrat midden database
    - Ostracodes
    - Diatoms
    - Isotopes (coming online soon)
    - Etc., etc.

## Scope and strengths of Neotoma
- Pliocene to present, global
- Multiproxy
- Chronology tools and storage

## Dataflow: getting data into and out of Neotoma
- Getting data in:
    - Contact a data steward and send data the old-fashioned way (via excel files, etc). List the data stewards.
    - Excel template?   
    - Download Tilia and enter data into Tilia file yourself.  Point people to resources, but this is not a Tilia training.

- Getting data out:
    - Neotoma Explorer
    - API
    - R
